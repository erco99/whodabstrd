## Introduction

This Chrome extension is designed to provide **instant visibility** into one of the most requested Instagram insights: 
the users you follow who **don’t follow you back**.

The extension performs a **scan of your Instagram Web profile page**, calling the same **internal Instagram APIs** 
already used by the platform to retrieve followers and following data. By cross-referencing these lists, it automatically
identifies accounts that do not reciprocate your follow.

The results are then displayed directly **at the top of your Instagram profile page**, with no redirects or external dashboards. 
All unmatched users are shown in a clean, structured grid, allowing you to quickly view profiles and manage **follow/unfollow actions** directly from the page.

The goal is to deliver a **simple, fast, and transparent tool** that enhances Instagram Web by surfacing information that 
already exists, **without unnecessary complexity or third-party services**.
Additionally, the extension is designed to **respect user privacy**: it **does not** require users to provide credentials, 
passwords, or session tokens. It works **entirely within Instagram Web** and operates only while the user is already logged in, 
leveraging the active session in the browser rather than external authentication mechanisms.
